<h2>Substitutions</h2>

Please if you cannot make a game either call someone in your skill level bracket yourself to replace you. An open slot on the ice is a waste! Please be responsible and get a sub.

<br />
Substitutions should be coordinated through the Team Rep who will replace players based on skill levels.  If you are unable to attend your scheduled game please notify your Team Rep of the player replacing you. <b>Know your Team Rep's phone number and email.</b>
