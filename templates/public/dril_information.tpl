<h1>D.R.I.L.</h1>
<h2>(Development, Recreation, Introduction, League)</h2>

<h3><a href="#schedule">D.R.I.L. Schedule</a></h3>

<h3>What is D.R.I.L.?</h3>
The D.R.I.L is a introduction no-check league created to compliment our main league (The Tri-City Senior Hockey League or TCSHL) as a way for players who may have may NEVER played before and want to develop their skills and/ or the older player who may still wish to play, but in a more recreational setting.
 
<h3>WHO IS ELIGIBLE?</h3>
 
The D.R.I.L will be comprised of players (it is a CO-ED league BTW) who are of the following situations:
<ol> 
<li>New or novice level hockey players of ALL ages (18 years of age or older) who wish to develop their new skills in a recreational setting BEFORE going to the regular TCSHL. Their emphasis will be on development.</li>
<li>The older (35 years of age or older) player who may wish due to physical limitations of age, ability, etc or simply wanting to play in a recreation based hockey sitting, either exclusively play in D.R.I.L OR, play in the regular TCSHL also. These players want to play in a relaxed sitting, with game play more toward the beginner player level.</li>
</ol>

All players must be approved by TCSHL board. ALL players must agree and keep in mind that the emphasis is on fun and helping others enjoy the "hockey experience". It is more commonly know to be a "beer league" atmosphere.
 
<h3>GAME PLAY AND TIMES</h3>
 
The D.R.I.L as of now, is going to be an "experiment". It is scheduled for only 10 games. Jerseys WILL be provided to the members. It is going to be scheduled on Monday evenings at 8:30 PM. (Time and day may change due to V.E.C events)
 
If the league takes off and much interest is shown, future games will be scheduled. That is why it is SO important to REGISTER (see "registration" on main TCSHL page)! If little interest is shown, the league may not come to fruition.
 
The first game will be September 21st at 8:30 PM. Meetings of registered DRIL players will happen before then.
 
The games will be in normal hockey format (5 skaters- 1 goalie) and will run roughly an hour. The play will be recreational and geared toward EVERYONE getting involved in playing.
Fun, exercise, and development of skills are the goal. One referee will drop the puck and help in controlling play. As stated, it is a "no-check" recreational league.
 
<h3>COST</h3>
 
The cost will be $120.00 for the 10 games (game jerseys included) and must be registered with USA Hockey (approximately $38.00 a year)
 
Please contact myself (Randie May) at randie.may@tcshl.com or call 308-440-2382. Or feel free to speak with ANY of our TCSHL board members (see TCSHL website).
 
Help will be given on how to obtain equipment, dressing, basic skills, etc as needed for the NEW hockey player.
 
This is TRULY a chance to start at the BEGINNING! Playing hockey is great fun and should be enjoyed by ALL! Regardless of age or ability! That is what we are hoping you will find in the D.R.I.L!
